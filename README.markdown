Vim Configuration
=================

This is the vim configuration I am using day to day. Plugins include nerdtree and snipmate. I've created diction=aries for both drupal 6 and drupal 7 core functions too. You'll need to reference the one you want to use in the .vimrc. Currently it is pointed at the drupal6 file

Installation
------------
If you want to install quickly run the install.sh file, but be warned, all it does is copy the .vimrc file to your home directory, so any old one will be overwritten. To be nice the old one will first be copied to '~/.vimrc.bak'.
